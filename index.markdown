# About the Archive

This project began out of disappointment. Why are spaces outside of the adoptee community silent on environmental injustices surrounding adoption? In the discourse surrounding uncertain toxic futurities, reproductive anxieties, and climate disasters, adoptees of color (and their birth families) are typically erased in narratives of environmentalism and rescue. 

Adoptee Literary and Art Archive aims to begin a conversation surrounding the intersections of transracial adoption, art, and environment. It argues that transracial adoptee environmentalisms are essential towards just environmental futures. 

First and foremost a resource for adoptees, it continues the legacy of adoptee activism which demands that adoptee voices are seen, heard, and felt as legitimate sites of knowledge. 

The archive will also serve as a wealth of primary resources for scholars interested in discussing adoption, environment, and uncertain climate futurities within the same breath.

Interested contributors must connect their work to the environment. ‘Environment’ is used broadly and includes the natural environment as well as built space. Works that navigate questions of uncertain climate futures are of particular interest, although this is not a requirement. A list of guiding prompts and questions are also available to contributors. There is no restriction on the type of art or literary work, although submissions must meet the eligibility requirements and follow the guidelines for their work. 

Adoptee Literary and Art Archive is a beginning, a reclamation, and one way in finding home. 

Please visit Submission Guidelines for instructions on how to contribute.
